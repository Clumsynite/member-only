# Anon Discussions

## Introduction

[Anon Discussions](https://anon-discussions.herokuapp.com/) is an anonymous message board, where messages can be viewed by anyone who visits the site but, they'll not be able to see who posted the message.

If you want to post a message you'll have to create a new account by clicking on the Sign up Button.

In order to view the OP's name you'll have to join us by clicking on the Join US button (which is only visible if you are logged in).

- Use this code to Join us: **HAVEFUN**

This'll promote you to an Insider, granting you permissions to read the author's name and message's timestamp.

Furthermore, there's another status promotion if you enter the Admin code.

- Use this code for Admin Access: **ROUNDTABLE**

Using this will promote you to admin, this'll grant you permission to delete messages. Use the admin status carefully.
